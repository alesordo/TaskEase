# TaskEase
Task management web service in a Kanban way. Containerized in Docker and developed with the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js).

`docker-compose up -d --build`

This will bring up all Docker services. Then you should be able to access the application from your browser at `http://localhost:4200` üò∏

## Deploy from source code üë®‚Äçüíª
