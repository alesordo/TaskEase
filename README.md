# TaskEase
Task management web service in a Kanban way. Containerized in Docker and developed with the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js).

## Deploy with Docker

If you're using Docker just clone the repository and from that folder run the command:
`docker-compose up -d --build`

This will bring up all Docker services. Then you should be able to access the application from your browser at `http://localhost:4200` üò∏

## Testing the backend

The backend (API) contains a unit testing file in the `tests` folder. They aim to cover all the endpoints of the code. The current coverage is as follows:
